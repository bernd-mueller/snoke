cutaneous_reflex_findingEPISEM;cutaneous reflex finding;superficial reflexes are motor responses to scraping of the skin. they are graded simply as present or absent, although markedly asymmetrical responses should be considered abnormal as well. these reflexes are quite different from the muscle stretch reflexes in that the sensory signal has to not only reach the spinal cord, but also must ascend the cord to reach the brain. the motor limb then has to descend the spinal cord to reach the motor neurons. as can be seen from the description, this is a polysynaptic reflex. this can be abolished by severe lower motor neuron damage or destruction of the sensory pathways from the skin that is stimulated. however, the utility of superficial reflexes is that they are decreased or abolished by conditions that interrupt the pathways between the brain and spinal cord (such as with spinal cord damage).;cutan reflex find;Superfici reflex are motor respons to scrape of the skin.

Parietal_Lobe_EpilepsyEPISEM;ilae 1989 parietal lobe epilepsies  partial lobe epilepsy syndromes are usually characterized by simple partial and secondarily generalized seizures. most seizures arising in the parietal lobe remain as simple partial seizures, but complex partial seizures may arise out of simple partial seizures and occur with spread beyond the parietal lobe. seizures arising from the parietal lobe have the following features: seizures are predominantly sensory with many characteristics. positive phenomena consist of tingling and a feeling of electricity, which may be confined or may spread in a jacksonian manner. there may be a desire to move a body part or a sensation as if a part were being moved. muscle tone may be lost. the parts most frequently involved are those with the largest cortical representation (e.g., the hand, arm, and face). there may be tongue sensations of crawling, stiffness, or coldness, and facial sensory phenomena may occur bilaterally. occasionally, an intraabdominal sensation of sinking, choking, or nausea may occur, particularly in cases of inferior and lateral parietal lobe involvement. rarely, there may be pain, which may take the form of a superficial burning dysesthesia, or a vague, very severe, painful sensation. parietal lobe visual phenomena may occur as hallucinations of a formed variety. metamorphopsia with distortions, foreshortenings, and elongations may occur, and are more frequently observed in cases of nondominant hemisphere discharges. negative phenomena include numbness, a feeling that a body part is absent, and a loss of awareness of a part or a half of the body, known as asomatognosia. this is particularly the case with nondominant hemisphere involvement. severe vertigo or disorientation in space may be indicative of inferior parietal lobe seizures. seizures in the dominant parietal lobe result in a variety of receptive or conductive languages disturbances. some well-lateralized genital sensations may occur with paracentral involvement. some rotatory or postural motor phenomena may occur. seizures of the paracentral lobule have a tendency to become secondarily generalized. ;pariet lobe epilepsi;ILAE 1989 Pariet lobe epilepsies  Partial lobe epilepsi syndrom are usual character by simpl partial and secondarili general seizures.

myokimiaEPISEM;myokimia;myokymia consists of involuntary, fine, continuous, undulating contractions that spread across the affected striated muscle. myokymia is characterized by spontaneous, fine fascicular contractions of muscle without muscular atrophy or weakness. eyelid myokymia results from fascicular contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscle. eyelid myokymia is typically unilateral, with the most common involvement being one of the lower eyelids. when multiple eyelids are involved, the fascicular contractions of each eyelid are independent of each other. in most cases, eyelid myokymia is benign, self-limited, and not associated with any disease. intervention is usually unnecessary. rarely, eyelid myokymia may occur as a precursor of hemifacial spasm, blepharospasm, meige syndrome, spastic-paretic facial contracture, and multiple sclerosis.;Myokymia consist of involuntary, fine, continuous, undul contract that spread across the affect striat muscle.

Consequ it was agre to be consistent, not onli in descript ictal terminology, but also in name epilept seizur type and syndromes, to avoid these terms.

In frontal lobe epilepsies, the interict scalp record may show (a) no abnormality; (b) sometim background asymmetry, frontal spike or sharp waves; or (c) sharp wave or slow wave (either unilater or frequent bilater or unilater multilobar). Intracrani record can sometim distinguish unilater from bilater involvement. In frontal lobe seizures, various EEG pattern can accompani the initi clinic symptomatology. Uncommonly, the EEG abnorm preced the seizur onset and then provid import local information, such as: (a) frontal or multilobar, often bilateral, low-amplitud fast activity, mix spikes, rhythmic spikes, rhythmic spike waves, or rhythmic slow waves; or (b) bilater high amplitud singl sharp wave follow by diffus flattening. Depend on the methodology, intracrani record may provid addit inform regard the chronolog and spatial evolut of the discharges; local may be difficult.

Neonatal_SeizuresEPISEM;neonat seizur;ilae 1989 neonatal seizures neonatal seizures differ from those of older children and adults. the most frequent neonatal seizures are described as subtle because the clinical manifestations are frequently overlooked. these include tonic, horizontal deviation of the eyes with or without jerking, eyelid blinking or fluttering, sucking, smacking, or other buccal-lingual oral movements, swimming or pedaling movements and, occasionally, apneic spells. other neonatal seizures occur as tonic extension of the limbs, mimicking decerebrate or decorticate posturing. these occur particularly in premature infants. multifocal clonic seizures characterized by clonic movements of a limb, which may migrate to other body parts or other limbs, or focal clonic seizures, which are much more localized, may occur. in the latter, the infant is usually not unconscious. rarely, myoclonic seizures may occur, and the eeg pattern is frequently that of suppression-burst activity. the tonic seizures have a poor prognosis because they frequently accompany intraventricular hemorrhage. the myoclonic seizures also have a poor prognosis because they are frequently a part of the early myoclonic encephalopathy syndrome. ;ILAE 1989 Neonat seizur Neonat seizur differ from those of older children and adults.

Epilepsy_with_Myoclonic_AbsenceEPISEM;epilepsi with myoclon absenc;ilae 1989 epilepsy with myoclonic absences the syndrome of epilepsy with myoclonic absences is clinically characterized by absences accompanied by severe bilateral rhythmical clonic jerks, often associated with a tonic contraction. on the eeg, these clinical features are always accompanied by bilateral, synchronous, and symmetrical discharge of rhythmical spike-waves at 3 hz, similar to childhood absence. seizures occur many times a day. awareness of the jerks may be maintained. associated seizures are rare. age of onset is -7 years, and there is a male preponderance. prognosis is less favorable than in pyknolepsy owing to resistance to therapy of the seizures, mental deterioration, and possible evolution to other types of epilepsy such as lennox-gastaut syndrome. engel 2001 epilepsy with myoclonic absences ;epilepsy with myoclonic absence;ILAE 1989 Epilepsi with myoclon absenc The syndrom of epilepsi with myoclon absenc is clinic character by absenc accompani by sever bilater rhythmic clonic jerks, often associ with a tonic contraction.
