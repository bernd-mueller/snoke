Epilepsy_DiseaseESSO;epilepsy disease;luders 1998 epilepsy classification the semiological seizure classification is a classification of the semiology of the seizures only. the epileptic syndrome, however, is defined by considering all clinical information (semiological seizure type, interictal eeg, ictal eeg, functional and anatomic neuroimaging, seizure evolution over time, neurological examination, and so on). in our institutions, we first define the epiteptic syndrome, then list the semiological characteristics of the patient’s seizures, state the presumed cause of the epileptic syndrome, and record important additional medical conditions which the patient has. this approach summarizes the essential features of the epilepsy and has been described in detail elsewhere (6). some illustrative examples follow. 1. left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy seizures: abdominal aura --> automotor seizure cause: left mesial temporal sclerosis related medical conditions: febrile convulsions, memory deficit, cerebellar atrophy 2. absence epilepsy seizures: typical dialeptic seizure --> generalized tonic-clonic seizure cause: genetic related medical conditions:none 3. lennox-gastaut syndrome seizures: generalized tonic seizure, dialeptic seizure, astatic seizure cause: tuberous sclerosis related medical conditions: mental retardation, depression 4. right frontal epilepsy seizures: asymmetric bilateral tonic seizure --> left arm clonic seizure --> generalized tonic clonic seizure cause: right mesial frontal cortical dysplasia related medical conditions: schizophrenia, mild mental retardation engel 2006 epilepsy disease: a pathological condition with a single specific, well-defined etiology. thus, progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a syndrome, but unverricht–lundborg is a disease (new concept). scheuermann 2009 epilepsy as a disease that disposes to the occurrence of seizures (pathological processes) due to an underlying abnormality in the neuronal circuitry of the brain (physical basis) fischer 2014 definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures >24 h apart. the task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a diseaseof the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures, and by theneurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. the definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure. term disease may (butnot always) convey a more lasting derangement of normal function the ilae and the international bureau for epilepsy (ibe) have recently agreed that epilepsy is best considered to be a disease. epilepsy exists in a patient who has had a seizure and whose brain, for whatever reason, demonstrates a pathologic and enduring tendency to have recurrent seizures. this tendency can be imagined as a pathologic lowering of the seizure threshold, when compared to persons without the condition. it makes little sense to say that someone has an epilepsy syndrome but not epilepsy. if evidence exists for an epilepsy syndrome, then epilepsy may be presumed to be present, even if the risk of subsequent seizures is low.;epilepsi diseas;Luder 1998 Epilepsi classif The semiolog seizur classif is a classif of the semiolog of the seizur only. The epilept syndrome, however, is defin by consid all clinic inform (semiolog seizur type, interict EEG, ictal EEG, function and anatom neuroimaging, seizur evolut over time, neurolog examination, and so on). In our institutions, we first defin the epitept syndrome, then list the semiolog characterist of the patient’ seizures, state the presum caus of the epilept syndrome, and record import addit medic condit which the patient has.

The definit of epilepsi requir the occurr of at least one epilept seizure. Term diseas may (butnot always) convey a more last derang of normal function The ILAE and the Internat Bureau for Epilepsi (IBE) have recent agre that epilepsi is best consid to be a disease. Epilepsi exist in a patient who has had a seizur and whose brain, for whatev reason, demonstr a patholog and endur tendenc to have recurr seizures. This tendenc can be imagin as a patholog lower of the seizur threshold, when compar to person without the condition. It make littl sens to say that someon has an epilepsi syndrom but not epilepsy.

As this terminolog is descript and phenomenologic, it use would not impli or requir knowledg of ictal pathophysiology, ani patholog substrate, or etiology. Mani term are adject modifi “seizure,” which itself is defin under “gener terms.” This pertain to seizur with singl or multipl components. Term in this glossari (e.g., “seizure,” “ictus,” which have widespread applic in other field of clinic neuroscience) are herein defin accord to their refer to epilepsy. Some term of this glossari are “fundamental” (i.e., they encompass other more precis words). These can be use as the sole descriptor when data to character a phenomenon more precis are not available. Such includ aura, automatism, experiential, motor, and sensory. A seizur will often consist of two or more phenomena occur simultan or sequenti and should be describ accordingly. Quantit terms, such as durat of motor events, are not intend as immut confines, but as clarifi guid to describ clinic observ events. Scientif progress dictat an evolut of term to retain their relevance. However, need of communic in everyday life requir that chang be gradual and evolutionari rather than abrupt and revolutionary. The use of synonym in this glossari reflect incid in which gradual chang are likely. Terminolog in some area remain unresolved. Therefor we view this glossari as a dynam process for which feedback will be welcomed. PRINCIPLES FOR TERMS AND DEFINITIONS In develop the “lexique” of this report, we adopt and appli the follow principles. Term and definit should 1. Contain featur that distinguish or modifi seizur entities. 2. Be descript of the phenomena involved. 3. Compli with terminolog of clinic neuroscience. 4.

Be readili understood and use by potenti users.  ;blume 2001 i l a e glossary;blume 2001 i l a e glossari;blume 2001 introduction this glossary intends to provide a standard terminology for health care workers to communicate what is observed and what a patient reports during a seizure. as this terminology is descriptive and phenomenologic, its use would not imply or require knowledge of ictal pathophysiology, any pathological substrate, or etiology. many terms are adjectives modifying “seizure,” which itself is defined under “general terms.” this pertains to seizures with single or multiple components. terms in this glossary (e.g., “seizure,” “ictus,” which have widespread applicability in other fields of clinical neuroscience) are herein defined according to their references to epilepsy. some terms of this glossary are “fundamental” (i.e., they encompass other more precise words). these can be used as the sole descriptor when data to characterize a phenomenon more precisely are not available. such include aura, automatism, experiential, motor, and sensory. a seizure will often consist of two or more phenomena occurring simultaneously or sequentially and should be described accordingly. quantitative terms, such as duration of motor events, are not intended as immutable confines, but as clarifying guides to describe clinically observed events. scientific progress dictates an evolution of terms to retain their relevance. however, needs of communication in everyday life require that changes be gradual and evolutionary rather than abrupt and revolutionary. the use of synonyms in this glossary reflects incidents in which gradual changes are likely. terminology in some areas remains unresolved. therefore we view this glossary as a dynamic process for which feedback will be welcomed. principles for terms and definitions in developing the “lexique” of this report, we adopted and applied the following principles. terms and definitions should 1. contain features that distinguish or modify seizure entities. 2. be descriptive of the phenomena involved. 3. comply with terminology of clinical neuroscience. 4. use current terminology and definitions wherever  possible. 5. contain new terms only if necessary. 6. be easily translatable to other languages. 7. be readily understood and used by potential users.

To avoid confus between term that identifi electroclin complex (absenc seizur and complex partial seizure) and term that identifi pure ictal sign and symptoms, we coin the term dialept seizur for ictal episod in which the main manifest is an alter of consciousness.

An epilepsi character by specif mode of seizur precipitation, however, is one in which a consist relationship can be recogn between the occurr of one or more defin nonict event and subsequ occurr of a specif stereotyp seizure. Some epilepsi have seizur precipit by specif sensat or percept (the reflex epilepsies) in which seizur occur in respons to discret or specif stimuli. These stimuli are usual limit in individu patient to a singl specif stimulus or a limit number of close relat stimuli. Although the epilepsi which result are usual general and of idiopath nature, certain partial seizur may also occur follow acquir lesions, usual involv tactil or propriocept stimuli. Epilept seizur may also be precipit by sudden arous (startl epilepsy); the stimulus is unexpect in nature. The seizur are usual general tonic but may be partial and are usual symptomatic. Seizur precipit by integr of higher cerebr function such as memori or pattern recognit are most often associ with complex partial epilepsies, but are occasion observ in general epilepsi (such as read epilepsy). Seizur also occur spontan in most such patients.;localization- related seizures with specific modes of precipitation;ilae 1989 precipitated seizures are those in which environmental or internal factors consistently precede the attacks and are differentiated from spontaneous epileptic attacks in which precipitating factors cannot be identified. certain nonspecific factors (e.g., sleeplessness, alcohol or drug withdrawal, or hyperventilation) are common precipitators and are not specific modes of seizure precipitation. in certain epileptic syndromes, the seizures clearly may be somewhat more susceptible to nonspecific factors, but this is only occasionally useful in classifying epileptic syndromes. an epilepsy characterized by specific modes of seizure precipitation, however, is one in which a consistent relationship can be recognized between the occurrence of one or more definable nonictal events and subsequent occurrence of a specific stereotyped seizure. some epilepsies have seizures precipitated by specific sensation or perception (the reflex epilepsies) in which seizures occur in response to discrete or specific stimuli. these stimuli are usually limited in individual patients to a single specific stimulus or a limited number of closely related stimuli. although the epilepsies which result are usually generalized and of idiopathic nature, certain partial seizures may also occur following acquired lesions, usually involving tactile or proprioceptive stimuli. epileptic seizures may also be precipitated by sudden arousal (startle epilepsy); the stimulus is unexpected in nature. the seizures are usually generalized tonic but may be partial and are usually symptomatic. seizures precipitated by integration of higher cerebral function such as memory or pattern recognition are most often associated with complex partial epilepsies, but are occasionally observed in generalized epilepsies (such as reading epilepsy). seizures also occur spontaneously in most such patients.

For instance, the Task Forc is propos that the term “febril convulsions” be replac by “febril seizures.”;ilae 1989 febrile convulsions febrile convulsions are an age-related disorder almost always characterized by generalized seizures occurring during an acute febrile illness. most febrile convulsions are brief and uncomplicated, but some may be more prolonged and followed by transient or permanent neurologic sequelae, such as the hemiplegia-hemiatrophy-epilepsy(hhe) syndrome. febrile convulsions tend to recur in about one-third of affected patients. controversy about the risks of developing epilepsy later have largely been resolved by some recent large studies; the overall risk is probably not more than 4%. the indications for prolonged drug prophylaxis against recurrence of febrile convulsions are now more clearly defined, and most individuals do not require prophylaxis. essentially, this condition is a relatively benign disorder of early childhood. engel 2001 another change in terminology evident in this document is the omission of the words “convulsion” and “convulsive” in the list of epileptic seizure types and epilepsy syndromes. the task force thought that these are nonspecific lay terms, and at times improperly used. consequently it was agreed to be consistent, not only in descriptive ictal terminology, but also in naming epileptic seizure types and syndromes, to avoid these terms. for instance, the task force is proposing that the term “febrile convulsions” be replaced by “febrile seizures.”;febrile convulsions;febril convuls

Its import is disproportion in comparison with it small size. Its function are associ with the mainten of homeostasi and with the surviv of the speci (eg. feeding, drinking, reproduction). The hypothalamus surround the floor and lower later side of the third ventricle. It extend anterior as far as the lamina terminali and caudal to the posterior edg of the mammillari bodies. It can be seen on the ventral surfac of the brain behind the optic chiasm and medial to the optic tracts. The region bound by the optic chiasm and tract and the mammillari bodi is known as the tuber cinereum. The median eminence, a swell in the anterior part of the tuber cinereum just behind the optic tract give rise to the infundibular stem (infundibulum) which expand to form the infundibular process. Togeth the median emin and the infundibular stem and process are call the neurohypophysis. The neurohypophysi constitut the posterior part of the hypophysi (also known as the pituitari gland).

Neonatal_SeizuresESSO;neonat seizur;ilae 1989 neonatal seizures neonatal seizures differ from those of older children and adults. the most frequent neonatal seizures are described as subtle because the clinical manifestations are frequently overlooked. these include tonic, horizontal deviation of the eyes with or without jerking, eyelid blinking or fluttering, sucking, smacking, or other buccal-lingual oral movements, swimming or pedaling movements and, occasionally, apneic spells. other neonatal seizures occur as tonic extension of the limbs, mimicking decerebrate or decorticate posturing. these occur particularly in premature infants. multifocal clonic seizures characterized by clonic movements of a limb, which may migrate to other body parts or other limbs, or focal clonic seizures, which are much more localized, may occur. in the latter, the infant is usually not unconscious. rarely, myoclonic seizures may occur, and the eeg pattern is frequently that of suppression-burst activity. the tonic seizures have a poor prognosis because they frequently accompany intraventricular hemorrhage. the myoclonic seizures also have a poor prognosis because they are frequently a part of the early myoclonic encephalopathy syndrome. ;ILAE 1989 Neonat seizur Neonat seizur differ from those of older children and adults.

From a symptomatolog point of view the follow are distinguished: a) eat automat (chewing, swallowing); b) automat of mimicry, express the subject’ emot state (usual of fear) dure the seizure; c) gestur automatisms, crude or elaborate; direct toward either the subject or his environment; d) ambulatori automatisms; e) verbal automatisms.” lctal epilept automat usual repres the releas of automat behavior under the influenc of cloud of conscious that accompani a general or partial epilept seizur (confusion automatisms). They may occur in complex partial seizur as well as in absenc seizures. Postict epilept automat may follow ani sever epilept seizure, especi a tonic-clon one, and are usual associ with confusion. While some regard masticatori or oropharyng automat as aris from the amygdala or insular and opercular regions, these movement are occasion seen in the general epilepsies, particular absenc seizures, and are not of local help. The same is true of mimicri and gestur automatisms. In the latter, fumbl of the clothes, scratching, and other complex motor activ may occur both in complex partial and absenc seizures. Ictal speech automat are occasion encountered. Ambulatori seizur again may occur either as prolong automat of absence, particular prolong absenc continuing, or of complex partial seizures. In the latter, a patient may occasion continu to drive a car, although may contraven traffic light regulations. There seem to be littl doubt that automat are a common featur of differ type of epilepsy. While they do not lend themselv to simpl anatom interpretation, they appear to have in common a discharg involv various area of the limbic system. Crude and elabor automat do occur in patient with absenc as well as complex partial seizures. Of greater signific is the precis descript histori of the seizures, the age of the patient, the presenc or absenc of an aura and of postict behavior includ the presenc or absenc of confusion. The EEG is of cardin localiz import here. Drowsi or somnol impli a sleep state from which the patient can be arous to make appropri motor and verbal responses. In stupor, the patient may make some spontan movement and can be arous by pain or other vigor appli stimuli to make avoid movements. The patient in confus make inappropri respons to his environ and is disori as regard place or time or person. Aura. A frequent use term in the descript of epilept seizur is aura. Accord to the Dictionari of Epilepsy, this term was introduc by Galen to describ the sensat of a breath of air felt by some subject prior to the onset of a seizure. Other have refer to the aura as the portion of a seizur experienc befor loss of conscious occurs. This loss of conscious may be the result of secondari general of the seizur discharg or of alter of conscious impart by the develop of a complex partial seizure. The aura is that portion of the seizur which occur befor conscious is lost and for which memori is retain afterwards. It may be that, as in simpl partial seizures, the aura is the whole seizure. Where conscious is subsequ lost, the aura is, in fact, the signal symptom of a complex partial seizure. An aura is a retrospect term which is describ after the seizur is ended.;i l a e 1981 1.2 complex partial seizures;i l a e 1981 1.2 complex partial seizur;bancaud 1981 clinical seizure type: b. complex partial seizures (with impairment of consciousness; may sometimes begin with simple symptomatology) eeg seizure type: unilateral or, frequently bilateral discharge, diffuse or focal in temporal or frontotemporal regions eeg interictal expression: local contralateral discharge unilateral or bilateral generally asynchronous focus; usually in the temporal or frontal regions b. seizures with complex symptomatology automatisms. (these may occur in both partial and generalized seizures. they are described in detail here for convenience.) in the dictionary of epilepsy (gastaut,1973), automatisms are described as “more or less coordinated adapted (eupractic or dyspractic) involuntary motor activity occurring during the state of clouding of consciousness either in the course of, or after an epileptic seizure, and usually followed by amnesia for the event. the automatism may be simply a continuation of an activity that was going on when the seizure occurred, or, conversely, a new activity developed in association with the ictal impairment of consciousness. usually, the activity is commonplace in nature, often provoked by the subject’s environment, or by his sensations during the seizure; exceptionally, fragmentary, primitive, infantile, or antisocial behavior is seen. from a symptomatological point of view the following are distinguished: a) eating automatisms (chewing, swallowing); b) automatism of mimicry, expressing the subject’s emotional state (usually of fear) during the seizure; c) gestural automatisms, crude or elaborate; directed toward either the subject or his environment; d) ambulatory automatisms; e) verbal automatisms.” lctal epileptic automatisms usually represent the release of automatic behavior under the influence of clouding of consciousness that accompanies a generalized or partial epileptic seizure (confusional automatisms). they may occur in complex partial seizures as well as in absence seizures. postictal epileptic automatisms may follow any severe epileptic seizure, especially a tonic-clonic one, and are usually associated with confusion. while some regard masticatory or oropharyngeal automatisms as arising from the amygdala or insular and opercular regions, these movements are occasionally seen in the generalized epilepsies, particularly absence seizures, and are not of localizing help. the same is true of mimicry and gestural automatisms. in the latter, fumbling of the clothes, scratching, and other complex motor activity may occur both in complex partial and absence seizures. ictal speech automatisms are occasionally encountered. ambulatory seizures again may occur either as prolonged automatisms of absence, particularly prolonged absence continuing, or of complex partial seizures. in the latter, a patient may occasionally continue to drive a car, although may contravene traffic light regulations. there seems to be little doubt that automatisms are a common feature of different types of epilepsy. while they do not lend themselves to simple anatomic interpretation, they appear to have in common a discharge involving various areas of the limbic system. crude and elaborate automatisms do occur in patients with absence as well as complex partial seizures. of greater significance is the precise descriptive history of the seizures, the age of the patient, the presence or absence of an aura and of postictal behavior including the presence or absence of confusion. the eeg is of cardinal localizational importance here. drowsiness or somnolence implies a sleep state from which the patient can be aroused to make appropriate motor and verbal responses. in stupor, the patient may make some spontaneous movement and can be aroused by painful or other vigorously applied stimuli to make avoidance movements. the patient in confusion makes inappropriate responses to his environment and is disoriented as regards place or time or person. aura. a frequently used term in the description of epileptic seizures is aura. according to the dictionary of epilepsy, this term was introduced by galen to describe the sensation of a breath of air felt by some subjects prior to the onset of a seizure. others have referred to the aura as the portion of a seizure experienced before loss of consciousness occurs. this loss of consciousness may be the result of secondary generalization of the seizure discharge or of alteration of consciousness imparted by the development of a complex partial seizure. the aura is that portion of the seizure which occurs before consciousness is lost and for which memory is retained afterwards. it may be that, as in simple partial seizures, the aura is the whole seizure. where consciousness is subsequently lost, the aura is, in fact, the signal symptom of a complex partial seizure. an aura is a retrospective term which is described after the seizure is ended.

Dialeptic_StatusESSO;luders 1998 dialeptic seizure location: left hemisphere/right hemisphere “dialeptic” seizures have as their main ictal manifestations an alteration of consciousness that is independent of ictal eeg manifestations. the new term “dialeptic” seizure has been coined to differentiate this concept from absence seizures (dialeptic seizures with a generalized ictal eeg) and complex partial seizures (dialeptic seizures with a focal ictal eeg). dialeptic seizures is a new term coined to identify seizures in which the predominant symptomatology consists of an alteration of consciousness (see discussion of terminology above). alteration of consciousness is difficult to define. however, for the purpose of identifying dialeptic seizures, we classify altered consciousness as does the ilae classification of epileptic electroclinical complexes, e.g., as episodes of unresponsiveness or decreased responsiveness that are not caused by motor alterations. dialeptic seizures are associated with complete or at least partial amnesia for the episode; therefore, amnesia of the episode is necessary to establish the diagnosis of dialeptic seizure. status epilepticus essentially any of the seizure forms described above can manifest as status epilepticus. status epilepticus is classified in the same way as the seizures by replacing the term “seizure” with “status”-e.g., dialeptic status, right foot clonic status. engel 2001 absence status epilepticus;dialept status;Luder 1998 Dialept Seizur Location: Left Hemisphere/Right Hemispher “Dialeptic” seizur have as their main ictal manifest an alter of conscious that is independ of ictal EEG manifestations.

Dialept seizur is a new term coin to identifi seizur in which the predomin symptomatolog consist of an alter of conscious (see discuss of terminolog above). Alterat of conscious is difficult to define. However, for the purpos of identifi dialept seizures, we classifi alter conscious as doe the ILAE classif of epilept electroclin complexes, e.g., as episod of unrespons or decreas respons that are not caus by motor alterations.

The intent is that the seizure-typ diagnosi will have implic with respect to etiology, approach to diagnost evaluation, treatment and prognosis. One critic of the ILAE approach to classif is that syndrom diagnos often cannot be made.

therefore, appropriate management of the patient will require that the physician define the epileptic syndrome. for example, establishing that a patient has dialeptic seizures does not tell us whether the patient has generalized epileptic syndrome such as absence epilepsy, which can be treated with ethosuximide, or a focal epileptic syndrome, in which ethosuximide is ineffective. 3. a semiological seizure classification focuses the attention of the observer on clinical semiology.  4. a semiological seizure classification in which we do not assume a one-to-one relationship between clinical semiology and other test results promotes scientific correlation studies between the different types of seizures (classified exclusively on the basis of ictal semiology) and other test results. such studies should eventually provide better understanding of the significance of different semiological features. 5. a semiological seizure classification, particularly if it is comprehensive, can be applied to any age group. however, certain types of seizures will not occur or will seldom occur in newborn and infants because of their incompletely developed nervous system. conclusion in this short outline, we introduce a semiological seizure classification. the present version—or variants of it-has been used in daily clinical practice for >10 years in selected epilepsy centers. the advantages of a semiological seizure classification are stressed.;luder 1998 1.0 overview;luders 1998 1.0 overview;Luder 1998 Our seizur classif is base exclus on ictal seizur semiology, either as report by the patient or observ or as analyz direct dure video monitor (Tabl 1). No EEG find or other test result influenc the classification. Ictal symptom can be produc by epilept interfer of one of the follow four “spheres”: a. Sensori sphere.  b. Conscious sphere. c.

SUMMARi OF THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEMIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURES The semiolog seizur classif outlin abov integr the follow features, which make it particular use for everyday application: 1. The terminolog appli is as succinct as possibl to facilit everyday use. 2. Whenev available, “classical” terminology, well known to general neurologist and epileptologists, has been used. 3. The classif includ a few new terms, such as automotor, hypomotor, hypermotor, and dialept seizures. These new term have been introduc to avoid confus with other term that identifi similar seizur but that are defin not by pure semiolog criteria but by electroclin characterist (see section Dialept seizures). 4. The semiolog seizur classif includ ‘‘somatotop modifiers’’ that permit definit of the somatotop distribut of the ictal symptoms. 5. Each seizur type is consid a component. Differ seizur evolut are express by link the differ seizur type (“components”) by an arrow. Type of seizur evolut are not limit arbitrarily. This classif system should permit scientif studi of the most frequent type of seizur evolutions. 6. Ictal symptom frequent cannot be defin with precis becaus of inadequ inform (for example, a patient may be amnest of the seizur and there may be no wit to the seizur or a wit may provid an incomplet and inaccur history). The semiolog differ classif permit classif of seizur with differ degre of precision. For example, if we believ that the patient had an epilept seizure, we classifi it as “epilept seizure.” If the main manifest was motor, we classifi the seizur as a “motor seizure.” If the main manifest was motor, we classifi the seizur as a “motor seizure.” If the motor seizur affect the right arm but we do not know if it was a simpl or complex motor seizure, we can classifi it as “right arm motor seizure.” If we know that the movement dure the seizur were “simple” (see definit above), but we have difficulti in defin the subtype, we can classifi the seizur as “right arm simpl motor seizure.” And finally, if by histori or direct observ we can establish that the movement of the right arm was of clonic type, we can classifi the seizur in it maximum degre of precision, name as “right arm clonic seizure.” In other words, from left to right in Tabl 1, progress more precis inform is provid about the ictal semiology. ADVANTAGES OF SEMIOLOGICAL SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION Semiolog classif of epilept seizur has the follow advantages: 1. It provid a terminolog that permit clear identif of ictal semiolog featur independ of ani other rest results. 2. It clarifi the differ between seizur classif and epilept syndrom classification. Mani epilept syndrom may be associ with the same type of seizur (when classifi semiologically); therefore, appropri manag of the patient will requir that the physician defin the epilept syndrome. For example, establish that a patient has dialept seizur doe not tell us whether the patient has general epilept syndrom such as absenc epilepsy, which can be treat with ethosuximide, or a focal epilept syndrome, in which ethosuximid is ineffective. 3. A semiolog seizur classif focus the attent of the observ on clinic semiology.  4. A semiolog seizur classif in which we do not assum a one-to-on relationship between clinic semiolog and other test result promot scientif correl studi between the differ type of seizur (classifi exclus on the basi of ictal semiology) and other test results. Such studi should eventu provid better understand of the signific of differ semiolog features. 5. A semiolog seizur classification, particular if it is comprehensive, can be appli to ani age group. However, certain type of seizur will not occur or will seldom occur in newborn and infant becaus of their incomplet develop nervous system. CONCLUSION In this short outline, we introduc a semiolog seizur classification. The present version—or variant of it-ha been use in daili clinic practic for >10 year in select epilepsi centers. The advantag of a semiolog seizur classif are stressed.

Luders_1998_ClassificationESSO;luders 1998 classification;luders 1998: classification seizure sequence most seizures consist of symptoms that evolve as the seizure discharge spreads to involve new cortical areas. in the semiological classification of seizures, this evolution is indicated by considering each one of the seizures described above as one component of a seizure. any given seizure consists of one or more of these components, which are listed in order of appearance and are linked by arrows. example: left visual aura → left hand clonic seizure → generalized tonic-clonic seizure left visual aura → bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure → left arm clonic seizure abdominal aura → left hemispheric automotor seizure olfactory aura → automotor seizure → left versive seizure → generalized tonic-clonic seizure generalized myoclonic seizure → generalized tonic-clonic seizure  typical dialeptic seizure → generalized tonic-clonic seizure typically, we limit the number of seizure components to four for practical purposes. epilepsy classification the semiological seizure classification is a classification of the semiology of the seizures only. the epileptic syndrome, however, is defined by considering all clinical information (semiological seizure type, interictal eeg, ictal eeg, functional and anatomic neuroimaging, seizure evolution over time, neurological examination, and so on). in our institutions, we first define the epileptic syndrome, then list the semiological characteristics of the patient’s seizures, state the presumed cause of the epileptic syndrome, and record important additional medical conditions which the patient has. this approach summarizes the essential features of the epilepsy and has been described in detail elsewhere (6). some illustrative examples follow. summary of the essential characteristics of the semiological classification of epileptic seizures the semiological seizure classification outlined above integrates the following features, which make it particularly useful for everyday application: 1. the terminology applied is as succinct as possible to facilitate everyday use. 2. whenever available, “classical” terminology, well known to general neurologists and epileptologists, has been used. 3. the classification includes a few new terms, such as automotor, hypomotor, hypermotor, and dialeptic seizures. these new terms have been introduced to avoid confusion with other terms that identify similar seizures but that are defined not by pure semiological criteria but by electroclinical characteristics (see section dialeptic seizures). 4. the semiological seizure classification includes ‘ ‘somatotopic modifiers’ ’ that permit definition of the somatotopic distribution of the ictal symptoms. 5. each seizure type is considered a component. different seizure evolutions are expressed by linking the different seizure types (“components”) by an arrow. types of seizure evolution are not limited arbitrarily. this classification system should permit scientific studies of the most frequent type of seizure evolutions. 6. ictal symptoms frequently cannot be defined with precision because of inadequate information (for example, a patient may be amnestic of the seizure and there may be no witness to the seizure or a witness may provide an incomplete and inaccurate history). the semiological difference classification permits classification of seizures with different degrees of precision. for example, if we believe that the patient had an epileptic seizure, we classify it as “epileptic seizure.” if the main manifestation was motor, we classify the seizure as a “motor seizure.” if the main manifestation was motor, we classify the seizure as a “motor seizure.” if the motor seizure affected the right arm but we do not know if it was a simple or complex motor seizure, we can classify it as “right arm motor seizure.” if we know that the movements during the seizure were “simple” (see definition above), but we have difficulty in defining the subtype, we can classify the seizure as “right arm simple motor seizure.” and finally, if by history or direct observation we can establish that the movement of the right arm was of clonic type, we can classify the seizure in its maximum degree of precision, namely as “right arm clonic seizure.” in other words, from left to right in table 1, progressively more precise information is provided about the ictal semiology. advantages of semiological seizure classification semiological classification of epileptic seizures has the following advantages: 1. it provides a terminology that permits clear identification of ictal semiological features independent of any other rest results. 2. it clarifies the difference between seizure classification and epileptic syndrome classification. many epileptic syndromes may be associated with the same types of seizures (when classified semiologically); therefore, appropriate management of the patient will require that the physician define the epileptic syndrome. for example, establishing that a patient has dialeptic seizures does not tell us whether the patient has a generalized epilpetic syndrome such as absence epilepsy, which can be treated with ethosuximide, or a focal epileptic syndrome, in which ethosuximide is ineffective. 3. a semiological seizure classification focuses the attention of the observer on clinical semiology. 4. a semiological seizure classification in which we do not assume a one-to-one relationship between clinical semiology and other test results promotes scientific correlation studies between the different types of seizures (classified exclusively on the basis of ictal semiology) and other test results. such studies should eventually provide better understanding of the significance of different semiological features. 5. a semiological seizure classification, particularly if it is comprehensive, can be applied to any age group. however, certain types of seizures will not occur or will seldome occur in newborn and infants because of their incompletely developed nervous system. conclusion in this short outline, we introduce a semiological seizure classification. the present version-or variants of it-has been used in daily clinical practice for > 10 years in selected epilepsy centers. the advantages of a semiological seizure classification are stressed. ;Luder 1998: Classif Seizur sequenc Most seizur consist of symptom that evolv as the seizur discharg spread to involv new cortic areas.

Ani given seizur consist of one or more of these components, which are list in order of appear and are link by arrows. Example: Left visual aura → left hand clonic seizur → general tonic-clon seizur Left visual aura → bilater asymmetr tonic seizur → left arm clonic seizur Abdomin aura → left hemispher automotor seizur Olfactori aura → automotor seizur → left versiv seizur → general tonic-clon seizur Gener myoclon seizur → general tonic-clon seizure  Typic dialept seizur → general tonic-clon seizur Typically, we limit the number of seizur compon to four for practic purposes. Epilepsi classif The semiolog seizur classif is a classif of the semiolog of the seizur only. The epilept syndrome, however, is defin by consid all clinic inform (semiolog seizur type, interict EEG, ictal EEG, function and anatom neuroimaging, seizur evolut over time, neurolog examination, and so on). In our institutions, we first defin the epilept syndrome, then list the semiolog characterist of the patient’ seizures, state the presum caus of the epilept syndrome, and record import addit medic condit which the patient has. This approach summar the essenti featur of the epilepsi and has been describ in detail elsewher (6). Some illustr exampl follow. SUMMARi OF THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEMIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURES The semiolog seizur classif outlin abov integr the follow features, which make it particular use for everyday application: 1. The terminolog appli is as succinct as possibl to facilit everyday use. 2. Whenev available, “classical” terminology, well known to general neurologist and epileptologists, has been used. 3. The classif includ a few new terms, such as automotor, hypomotor, hypermotor, and dialept seizures. These new term have been introduc to avoid confus with other term that identifi similar seizur but that are defin not by pure semiolog criteria but by electroclin characterist (see section Dialept seizures). 4. The semiolog seizur classif includ ‘ ‘somatotop modifiers’ ’ that permit definit of the somatotop distribut of the ictal symptoms. 5. Each seizur type is consid a component. Differ seizur evolut are express by link the differ seizur type (“components”) by an arrow. Type of seizur evolut are not limit arbitrarily. This classif system should permit scientif studi of the most frequent type of seizur evolutions. 6. Ictal symptom frequent cannot be defin with precis becaus of inadequ inform (for example, a patient may be amnest of the seizur and there may be no wit to the seizur or a wit may provid an incomplet and inaccur history). The semiolog differ classif permit classif of seizur with differ degre of precision. For example, if we believ that the patient had an epilept seizure, we classifi it as “epilept seizure.” If the main manifest was motor, we classifi the seizur as a “motor seizure.” If the main manifest was motor, we classifi the seizur as a “motor seizure.” If the motor seizur affect the right arm but we do not know if it was a simpl or complex motor seizure, we can classifi it as “right arm motor seizure.” If we know that the movement dure the seizur were “simple” (see definit above), but we have difficulti in defin the subtype, we can classifi the seizur as “right arm simpl motor seizure.” And finally, if by histori or direct observ we can establish that the movement of the right arm was of clonic type, we can classifi the seizur in it maximum degre of precision, name as “right arm clonic seizure.” In other words, from left to right in Tabl 1, progress more precis inform is provid about the ictal semiology. ADVANTAGES OF SEMIOLOGICAL SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION Semiolog classif of epilept seizur has the follow advantages: 1. It provid a terminolog that permit clear identif of ictal semiolog featur independ of ani other rest results. 2. It clarifi the differ between seizur classif and epilept syndrom classification. Mani epilept syndrom may be associ with the same type of seizur (when classifi semiologically); therefore, appropri manag of the patient will requir that the physician defin the epilept syndrome. For example, establish that a patient has dialept seizur doe not tell us whether the patient has a general epilpet syndrom such as absenc epilepsy, which can be treat with ethosuximide, or a focal epilept syndrome, in which ethosuximid is ineffective. 3. A semiolog seizur classif focus the attent of the observ on clinic semiology. 4. A semiolog seizur classif in which we do not assum a one-to-on relationship between clinic semiolog and other test result promot scientif correl studi between the differ type of seizur (classifi exclus on the basi of ictal semiology) and other test results. Such studi should eventu provid better understand of the signific of differ semiolog features. 5. A semiolog seizur classification, particular if it is comprehensive, can be appli to ani age group. However, certain type of seizur will not occur or will seldom occur in newborn and infant becaus of their incomplet develop nervous system. CONCLUSION In this short outline, we introduc a semiolog seizur classification. The present version-or variant of it-ha been use in daili clinic practic for > 10 year in select epilepsi centers. The advantag of a semiolog seizur classif are stressed.;luder 1998 classif

(2) seizure types and syndromes change as new information is obtained. (3) complete and detailed descriptions of ictal phenomenology are not always necessary. (4) multiple classification schemes can, and should, be designed for specific purposes (e.g. communication and teaching; therapeutic trials; epidemiological investigations; selection of surgical candidates; basic research; genetic characterizations). this diagnostic scheme is divided into five parts, or axes, organized to facilitate a logical clinical approach to the development of hypotheses necessary to determine the diagnostic studies and therapeutic strategies to be undertaken in individual patients: axis 1: ictal phenomenology—from the glossary of descriptive ictal terminology, can be used to describe ictal events with any degree of detail needed. asix 2: seizure type: from the list of epileptic seizures. localization within the brain and precipitating stimuli for reflex seizures should be specified when appropriate. axis 3: syndrome: from the list of epilepsy syndromes, with the understanding that a syndromic diagnosis may not always be possible. axis 4: etiology: from a classification of diseases frequently associated with epileptic seizures or epilepsy syndromes when possible, genetic defects, or specific pathological substrates for symptomatic focal epilepsies. axis 5: impairment: this optional, but often useful, additional diagnostic parameter can be derived from an impairment classification adapted from the who icidh-2. the diagnostic scheme described here will be made up of flexible and dynamic modules within which the task force will make periodic changes and updates as needed, with the approval of the executive committee. the task force is proposing that this diagnostic scheme include the development of flexible, rather than rigid, classifications, eliminating the need for the general assembly, which meets only once every 2 years, to agree on every revision. acceptance of this diagnostic scheme, therefore, does not exclude the creation of various classification systems for seizures and syndromes, or the continued use of some aspects of the current classification. the task force will be concerned with the construction of classification systems during the next executive term, but it is anticipated that seizures and syndromes will not be organized into fixed dichotomous classifications, but rather categorized in various ways for various purposes.

Structures: Cerebr Commissur Cerebr Hemispher Corpus Callosum - Bodi Corpus Callosum - Genu Corpus Callosum - Splenium Forcep Major Forcep Minor Primari Somatosensori Area Information: The Corpus Callosum is the largest of the cerebr commissures. It contain approxim 300 million fibres, connect the cortex of the two cerebr hemispheres. It consist of 4 part - the splenium (posterior), body, genu (anterior) and rostrum (contin antero-inferior with the genu). Fibr from the genu radiat anterior into the anterior region of the frontal lobe are known as the forcep minor. Fibr of the splenium, which radiat posterior into the occipit lobe are known as the forcep major. The function of the corpus callosum is to allow for the transfer of inform from one hemispher to anoth and to enabl memori trace to be store bilaterally. In case of sever epilepsi the corpus callosum is sometim sever to limit the extent of seizures, and subsequ behaviour studi in these patient have allow us to gain some insight into the role of the corpus callosum. While there are no obvious personality, intellectu or motor chang in these split-brain patients, there are some subtl chang particular in regard to learning. For example, a task learn with one hand cannot then be perform effici with the other hand becaus the memori trace cannot be transfer to the opposit hemisphere. Similarly, an object held in the left hand (but not seen) cannot be describ verbal becaus the somatosensori inform cannot be transfer from the primari somatosensori area of the right hemispher across to the left hemispher (where the languag area are usual located);corpus callosum;trancred 2005 the corpus callosum, the largest of the cerebral commissures, allows information to be transmitted from one cerebral hemisphere to the other, enabling memory traces to be stored bilaterally. structures: cerebral commissures cerebral hemisphere corpus callosum - body corpus callosum - genu corpus callosum - splenium forceps major forceps minor primary somatosensory area information: the corpus callosum is the largest of the cerebral commissures. it contains approximately 300 million fibres, connecting the cortex of the two cerebral hemispheres. it consists of 4 parts - the splenium (posterior), body, genu (anterior) and rostrum (continous antero-inferiorly with the genu). fibres from the genu radiate anteriorly into the anterior region of the frontal lobes are known as the forceps minor. fibres of the splenium, which radiate posteriorly into the occipital lobes are known as the forceps major. the function of the corpus callosum is to allow for the transfer of information from one hemisphere to another and to enable memory traces to be stored bilaterally. in cases of severe epilepsy the corpus callosum is sometimes severed to limit the extent of seizures, and subsequent behavioural studies in these patients have allowed us to gain some insight into the role of the corpus callosum. while there are no obvious personality, intellectual or motor changes in these 'split-brain' patients, there are some subtle changes particularly in regard to learning. for example, a task learned with one hand cannot then be performed efficiently with the other hand because the memory trace cannot be transferred to the opposite hemisphere. similarly, an object held in the left hand (but not seen) cannot be described verbally because the somatosensory information cannot be transferred from the primary somatosensory area of the right hemisphere across to the left hemisphere (where the language areas are usually located)

The cortex of both primari and premotor area is of the agranular type, be domin by pyramid cell (see Cerebr Cortex - Histology). The primari motor area is characteris by the presenc of extrem larg pyramid cell in layer 5. Some of these cell reach100�m in diamet and are known as the giant cell of Betz. The primari motor area receiv input from the premotor and primari somatosensori area of cortex as well as from the motor (ventral later and ventral anterior) nuclei of the thalamus. The major output of the primari motor area is to the corticospin tract which termin in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and is particular import in the control of non-stereotyp movement of the limbs, in particular movement of the hand and fingers. The primari motor area is somatotop organis with stimul result in movement of discret muscl group in the contralater half of the body, the muscl group be depend on the specif locat of the stimulus. The somatotop map of the primari motor area is known as the motor homunculus. Like the sensori homunculus, the head is repres most later and the feet most medially. There is a disproportion larg represent of the muscl of the face and hands. Movement can also be elicit by stimul of the premotor area but the primari motor area has a lower threshold (ie. is more sensitive) to stimulation.

Automotor_SeizureESSO;bancaud 1981 automatisms. (these may occur in both partial and generalized seizures. they are described in detail here for convenience.) in the dictionary of epilepsy (gastaut,1973), automatisms are described as “more or less coordinated adapted (eupractic or dyspractic) involuntary motor activity occurring during the state of clouding of consciousness either in the course of, or after an epileptic seizure, and usually followed by amnesia for the event. the automatism may be simply a continuation of an activity that was going on when the seizure occurred, or, conversely, a new activity developed in association with the ictal impairment of consciousness. usually, the activity is commonplace in nature, often provoked by the subject’s environment, or by his sensations during the seizure; exceptionally, fragmentary, primitive, infantile, or antisocial behavior is seen. from a symptomatological point of view the following are distinguished: a) eating automatisms (chewing, swallowing); b) automatism of mimicry, expressing the subject’s emotional state (usually of fear) during the seizure; c) gestural automatisms, crude or elaborate; directed toward either the subject or his environment; d) ambulatory automatisms; e) verbal automatisms.” lctal epileptic automatisms usually represent the release of automatic behavior under the influence of clouding of consciousness that accompanies a generalized or partial epileptic seizure (confusional automatisms). they may occur in complex partial seizures as well as in absence seizures. postictal epileptic automatisms may follow any severe epileptic seizure, especially a tonic-clonic one, and are usually associated with confusion. while some regard masticatory or oropharyngeal automatisms as arising from the amygdala or insular and opercular regions, these movements are occasionally seen in the generalized epilepsies, particularly absence seizures, and are not of localizing help. the same is true of mimicry and gestural automatisms. in the latter, fumbling of the clothes, scratching, and other complex motor activity may occur both in complex partial and absence seizures. ictal speech automatisms are occasionally encountered. ambulatory seizures again may occur either as prolonged automatisms of absence, particularly prolonged absence continuing, or of complex partial seizures. in the latter, a patient may occasionally continue to drive a car, although may contravene traffic light regulations. there seems to be little doubt that automatisms are a common feature of different types of epilepsy. while they do not lend themselves to simple anatomic interpretation, they appear to have in common a discharge involving various areas of the limbic system. crude and elaborate automatisms do occur in patients with absence as well as complex partial seizures. of greater significance is the precise descriptive history of the seizures, the age of the patient, the presence or absence of an aura and of postictal behavior including the presence or absence of confusion. the eeg is of cardinal localizational importance here. luders 1998 automotor seizure location: left hemisphere/right hemisphere automotor seizures are complex motor seizures in which the main manifestations consist of automatisms involving the distal segments of the hands and feet or the mouth and tongue. consciousness is usually affected but may be preserved, particularly when the seizure originates from the nondominant hemisphere.;automotor seizure;Bancaud 1981 Automatisms. (These may occur in both partial and general seizures. They are describ in detail here for convenience.) In the Dictionari of Epilepsi (Gastaut,1973), automat are describ as “more or less coordin adapt (eupract or dyspractic) involuntari motor activ occur dure the state of cloud of conscious either in the cours of, or after an epilept seizure, and usual follow by amnesia for the event. The automat may be simpli a continu of an activ that was go on when the seizur occurred, or, conversely, a new activ develop in associ with the ictal impair of consciousness. Usually, the activ is commonplac in nature, often provok by the subject’ environment, or by his sensat dure the seizure; exceptionally, fragmentary, primitive, infantile, or antisoci behavior is seen. From a symptomatolog point of view the follow are distinguished: a) eat automat (chewing, swallowing); b) automat of mimicry, express the subject’ emot state (usual of fear) dure the seizure; c) gestur automatisms, crude or elaborate; direct toward either the subject or his environment; d) ambulatori automatisms; e) verbal automatisms.” lctal epilept automat usual repres the releas of automat behavior under the influenc of cloud of conscious that accompani a general or partial epilept seizur (confusion automatisms). They may occur in complex partial seizur as well as in absenc seizures. Postict epilept automat may follow ani sever epilept seizure, especi a tonic-clon one, and are usual associ with confusion. While some regard masticatori or oropharyng automat as aris from the amygdala or insular and opercular regions, these movement are occasion seen in the general epilepsies, particular absenc seizures, and are not of local help. The same is true of mimicri and gestur automatisms. In the latter, fumbl of the clothes, scratching, and other complex motor activ may occur both in complex partial and absenc seizures. Ictal speech automat are occasion encountered. Ambulatori seizur again may occur either as prolong automat of absence, particular prolong absenc continuing, or of complex partial seizures. In the latter, a patient may occasion continu to drive a car, although may contraven traffic light regulations. There seem to be littl doubt that automat are a common featur of differ type of epilepsy. While they do not lend themselv to simpl anatom interpretation, they appear to have in common a discharg involv various area of the limbic system. Crude and elabor automat do occur in patient with absenc as well as complex partial seizures. Of greater signific is the precis descript histori of the seizures, the age of the patient, the presenc or absenc of an aura and of postict behavior includ the presenc or absenc of confusion.

Generalized_Epilepsies_with_Seizures_Precipitated_by_Specific_Modes_of_ActivationESSO;ILAE 1989 Precipit seizur are those in which environment or intern factor consist preced the attack and are differenti from spontan epilept attack in which precipit factor cannot be identified. Certain nonspecif factor (e.g., sleeplessness, alcohol or drug withdrawal, or hyperventilation) are common precipit and are not specif mode of seizur precipitation. In certain epilept syndromes, the seizur clear may be somewhat more suscept to nonspecif factors, but this is onli occasion use in classifi epilept syndromes. An epilepsi character by specif mode of seizur precipitation, however, is one in which a consist relationship can be recogn between the occurr of one or more defin nonict event and subsequ occurr of a specif stereotyp seizure. Some epilepsi have seizur precipit by specif sensat or percept (the reflex epilepsies) in which seizur occur in respons to discret or specif stimuli. These stimuli are usual limit in individu patient to a singl specif stimulus or a limit number of close relat stimuli. Although the epilepsi which result are usual general and of idiopath nature, certain partial seizur may also occur follow acquir lesions, usual involv tactil or propriocept stimuli. Epilept seizur may also be precipit by sudden arous (startl epilepsy); the stimulus is unexpect in nature. The seizur are usual general tonic but may be partial and are usual symptomatic. Seizur precipit by integr of higher cerebr function such as memori or pattern recognit are most often associ with complex partial epilepsies, but are occasion observ in general epilepsi (such as read epilepsy). Seizur also occur spontan in most such patients.;generalized epilepsies with seizures precipitated by specific modes of activation;general epilepsi with seizur precipit by specif mode of activ;ilae 1989 precipitated seizures are those in which environmental or internal factors consistently precede the attacks and are differentiated from spontaneous epileptic attacks in which precipitating factors cannot be identified. certain nonspecific factors (e.g., sleeplessness, alcohol or drug withdrawal, or hyperventilation) are common precipitators and are not specific modes of seizure precipitation. in certain epileptic syndromes, the seizures clearly may be somewhat more susceptible to nonspecific factors, but this is only occasionally useful in classifying epileptic syndromes. an epilepsy characterized by specific modes of seizure precipitation, however, is one in which a consistent relationship can be recognized between the occurrence of one or more definable nonictal events and subsequent occurrence of a specific stereotyped seizure. some epilepsies have seizures precipitated by specific sensation or perception (the reflex epilepsies) in which seizures occur in response to discrete or specific stimuli. these stimuli are usually limited in individual patients to a single specific stimulus or a limited number of closely related stimuli. although the epilepsies which result are usually generalized and of idiopathic nature, certain partial seizures may also occur following acquired lesions, usually involving tactile or proprioceptive stimuli. epileptic seizures may also be precipitated by sudden arousal (startle epilepsy); the stimulus is unexpected in nature. the seizures are usually generalized tonic but may be partial and are usually symptomatic. seizures precipitated by integration of higher cerebral function such as memory or pattern recognition are most often associated with complex partial epilepsies, but are occasionally observed in generalized epilepsies (such as reading epilepsy). seizures also occur spontaneously in most such patients.

ILAE_1981_1.0_Partial_SeizuresESSO;Bancaud 1981 I. Partial (Focal, Local) Seizur Partial seizur are those in which, in general, the first clinic and electroencephalograph chang indic initi activ of a system of neuron limit to part of one cerebr hemisphere. A partial seizur is classifi primarili on the basi of whether or not conscious is impair dure the attack. When conscious is not impaired, the seizur is classifi as a simpl partial seizure. When conscious is impaired, the seizur is classifi as a complex partial seizure. Impairment of conscious may be the first clinic sign, or simpl partial seizur may evolv into complex partial seizures. In patient with impair consciousness, aberr of behavior (automatisms) may occur. A partial seizur may not terminate, but instead progress to a general motor seizure. Impair conscious is defin as the inabl to respond normal to exogen stimuli by virtu of alter awar and/or respons (vide infra: Definit of Terms). There is consider evid that simpl partial seizur usual have unilater hemispher involv and onli rare have bilater hemispher involvement; complex partial seizures, however, frequent have bilater hemispher involvement. Partial seizur can be classifi into one of the follow three fundament groups: A. Simpl partial seizur B. Complex partial seizur   1. With impair of conscious at onset   2. Simpl partial onset follow by impair of conscious C. Partial seizur evolv to general tonic-clon convuls (GTC)   1. Simpl evolv to GTC  2. Complex evolv to GTC (includ those with simpl partial onset) Partial Seizur The fundament distinct between simpl partial seizur and complex partial, seizur is the presenc or the impair of the fulli conscious state. Conscious has been defin as “that integr activ by which Man grasp the total of his phenomen field” (Evans, 1972) and incorpor it into his experience. It correspond to “Bewusstsein” and is thus much more than “Vigilance,” for were it onli vigil (which is a degre of clarity) then onli confusion state would be repres of disord consciousness. Operat in the context of this classification, conscious refer to the degre of awar and/or respons of the patient to extern appli stimuli. Respons refer to the abil of the patient to carri out simpl command or will movement and awar refer to the patient’ contact with event dure the period in question and it recall. A person awar and unrespons will be abl to recount the event that occur dure an attack and his inabl to respond by movement or speech. In this context, unrespons is other than the result of paralysis, aphasia or apraxia.;i l a e 1981 1.0 partial seizures;i l a e 1981 1.0 partial seizur;bancaud 1981 i. partial (focal, local) seizures partial seizures are those in which, in general, the first clinical and electroencephalographic changes indicate initial activation of a system of neurons limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere. a partial seizure is classified primarily on the basis of whether or not consciousness is impaired during the attack. when consciousness is not impaired, the seizure is classified as a simple partial seizure. when consciousness is impaired, the seizure is classified as a complex partial seizure. impairment of consciousness may be the first clinical sign, or simple partial seizures may evolve into complex partial seizures. in patients with impaired consciousness, aberrations of behavior (automatisms) may occur. a partial seizure may not terminate, but instead progress to a generalized motor seizure. impaired consciousness is defined as the inability to respond normally to exogenous stimuli by virtue of altered awareness and/or responsiveness (vide infra: definition of terms). there is considerable evidence that simple partial seizures usually have unilateral hemispheric involvement and only rarely have bilateral hemispheric involvement; complex partial seizures, however, frequently have bilateral hemispheric involvement. partial seizures can be classified into one of the following three fundamental groups: a. simple partial seizures b. complex partial seizures   1. with impairment of consciousness at onset   2. simple partial onset followed by impairment of consciousness c. partial seizures evolving to generalized tonic-clonic convulsions (gtc)   1. simple evolving to gtc  2. complex evolving to gtc (including those with simple partial onset) partial seizures the fundamental distinction between simple partial seizures and complex partial, seizures is the presence or the impairment of the fully conscious state. consciousness has been defined as “that integrating activity by which man grasps the totality of his phenomenal field” (evans, 1972) and incorporates it into his experience. it corresponds to “bewusstsein” and is thus much more than “vigilance,” for were it only vigilance (which is a degree of clarity) then only confusional states would be representative of disordered consciousness. operationally in the context of this classification, consciousness refers to the degree of awareness and/or responsiveness of the patient to externally applied stimuli. responsiveness refers to the ability of the patient to carry out simple commands or willed movement and awareness refers to the patient’s contact with events during the period in question and its recall. a person aware and unresponsive will be able to recount the events that occurred during an attack and his inability to respond by movement or speech. in this context, unresponsiveness is other than the result of paralysis, aphasia or apraxia.

Absence_SeizureESSO;bancaud 1981 a. absence seizures the hallmark of the absence attack is a sudden onset, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward rotation of the eyes. if the patient is speaking, speech is slowed or interrupted; if walking, he stands transfixed; if eating, the food will stop on his way to the mouth. usually the patient will be unresponsive when spoken to. in some, attacks are aborted when the patient is spoken to. the attack lasts from a few seconds to half a minute and evaporates as rapidly as it commenced. 1. absence with impairment of consciousness only. the above description fits the description of absence simple in which no other activities take place during the attack. 2. absence with mild clonic components. here the onset of the attack is indistinguishable from the above, but clonic movements may occur in the eyelids, at the corner of the mouth, or in other muscle groups which may vary in severity from almost imperceptible movements to generalized myoclonic jerks. objects held in the hand may be dropped. 3. absence with atonic components. here there may be a diminution in tone of muscles subserving posture as well as in the limbs leading to drooping of the head, occasionally slumping of the trunk, dropping of the arms, and relaxation of the grip. rarely, tone is sufficiently diminished to cause this person to fall. 4. absence with tonic components. here during the attack tonic muscular contraction may occur, leading to increase in muscle tone which may affect the extensor muscles or the flexor muscles symmetrically or asymmetrically. if the patient is standing the head may be drawn backward and the trunk may arch. this may lead to retropulsion. the head may tonically draw to one or another side. 5. absence with automatisms. (see also prior discussion on automatisms.) purposeful or quasipurposeful movements occurring in the absence of awareness during an absence attack are frequent and may range from lip licking and swallowing to clothes fumbling or aimless walking. if spoken to the patient may grunt or turn to the spoken voice and when touched or tickled may rub the site. automatisms are quite elaborate and may consist of combinations of the above-described movements or may be so simple as to be missed by casual observation. mixed forms of absence frequently occur. luders 1998 for example, an episode of altered consciousness associated with generalized 3- hz, spike-and-wave eeg activity is identified as an absence seizure.;absence seizure;absenc seizur;Bancaud 1981 A. Absenc Seizur The hallmark of the absenc attack is a sudden onset, interrupt of ongo activities, a blank stare, possibl a brief upward rotat of the eyes. If the patient is speaking, speech is slow or interrupted; if walking, he stand transfixed; if eating, the food will stop on his way to the mouth. Usualli the patient will be unrespons when spoken to. In some, attack are abort when the patient is spoken to. The attack last from a few second to half a minut and evapor as rapid as it commenced. 1. Absenc with impair of conscious only. The abov descript fit the descript of absenc simpl in which no other activ take place dure the attack. 2. Absenc with mild clonic components. Here the onset of the attack is indistinguish from the above, but clonic mov may occur in the eyelids, at the corn of the mouth, or in other muscle group which may vari in sever from almost impercept movement to general myoclon jerks. Object held in the hand may be dropped. 3. Absenc with aton components. Here there may be a diminut in tone of muscl subserv postur as well as in the limb lead to droop of the head, occasion slump of the trunk, drop of the arms, and relax of the grip. Rarely, tone is suffici diminish to caus this person to fall. 4. Absenc with tonic components. Here dure the attack tonic muscular contract may occur, lead to increas in muscl tone which may affect the extensor muscl or the flexor muscl symmetr or asymmetrically. If the patient is stand the head may be drawn backward and the trunk may arch. This may lead to retropulsion. The head may tonic draw to one or anoth side. 5. Absenc with automatisms. (See also prior discuss on automatisms.) Purpos or quasipurpos movement occur in the absenc of awar dure an absenc attack are frequent and may rang from lip lick and swallow to cloth fumbl or aimless walking. If spoken to the patient may grunt or turn to the spoken voic and when touch or tickl may rub the site.
