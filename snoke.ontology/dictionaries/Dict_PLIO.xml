<variant base="another way that people often look at the binding equilibrium is to focus on the dissociation constant, kd, instead of the binding constant, kb. the dissociation constant is simply the reciprocal of the binding constant. kd = 1/ kb= ( [p ]eq [l]eq ) / ( [p •l]eq ) it provides exactly the same information. however, it has a pleasing interpretation: it is the concentration of ligand that gives even odds that a given protein molecule has a ligand bound. that is, for a one-to-one ratio of [p]eq to [p•l]eq, [l]eq = kd. thus, if one imagines gradually adding more and more ligand and monitoring the increasing fraction of ligand-bound protein, then [l]= kd will be the concentration of ligand for which half the protein is bound. thus, the lower the value of kd, the higher the affinity of the ligand. in the drug discovery process, a drug-like ligand with kd in the millimolar range is considered rather uninteresting; kd in the low micromolar range might indicate a lead compound (above) worth further chemical optimization; and kd of low nanomolar or below is good enough for a viable drug candidate. it follows that the smaller kd, the stronger the binding. so 10-6m (or 1mm) indicates weak binding compared to 10-9m (or 1nm). 10-6 means 10 in the pwer of -6 10-9 means 10 in the pwer of -9 kd refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a ligand determined directly in a binding assay using a labeled form of the ligand."/>
